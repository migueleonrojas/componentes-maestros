00:00:04.040-->00:00:06.120
You're scared of heights, that's vertigo

00:00:06.230-->00:00:09.070
You wanted lights, go see a show

00:00:09.150-->00:00:12.000
You ran away, that's touch and go

00:00:12.150-->00:00:14.200
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:00:15.100-->00:00:16.200
Well, aren't we all?

00:00:20.180-->00:00:22.130
well, aren't we all?

00:00:28.100-->00:00:32.210
I know that you started to feel what I feel

00:00:34.010-->00:00:38.220
I could tell 'cause you took my hand by the wheel

00:00:39.120-->00:00:44.040
But you couldn't dare to make it real

00:00:45.010-->00:00:49.110
Oh, it's such a shame, you left it here

00:00:50.050-->00:00:52.160
And I wasn't asking for a lifetime

00:00:53.070-->00:00:55.090
I was just asking you to take my hand

00:00:56.110-->00:00:57.180
Just for a minute or a night

00:00:58.010-->00:00:59.110
But was it too much to ask?

00:01:00.040-->00:01:02.050
You're scared of heights, that's vertigo

00:01:02.023-->00:01:05.000
You wanted lights, go see a show

00:01:05.160-->00:01:07.210
You ran away, that's touch and go

00:01:08.140-->00:01:10.140
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:01:11.100-->00:01:13.130
You felt alive, that's chemical

00:01:13.190-->00:01:16.050
You felt secure, that's called a home

00:01:16.180-->00:01:19.040
Couldn't take the heat, that's Mexico

00:01:19.140-->00:01:21.200
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:01:22.040-->00:01:24.010
Well, aren't we all?

00:01:27.180-->00:01:29.050
Well, aren't we all?

00:01:33.110-->00:01:36.010
I thought that I could be the one to change you

00:01:36.100-->00:01:38.190
I thought that I could be the one to prove

00:01:39.100-->00:01:41.120
I'm used to fixing broken things before

00:01:41.190-->00:01:44.080
I thought maybe I could fix you too

00:01:44.220-->00:01:46.230
I wasn't asking for a lifetime

00:01:47.220-->00:01:50.010
I was just asking you to take my hand

00:01:50.220-->00:01:52.010
For just a minute or a night

00:01:52.010-->00:01:54.200
But was it too much to ask?

00:01:54.230-->00:01:58.020
Hey, You're scared of heights, that's vertigo

00:01:58.130-->00:02:00.200
You wanted lights, go see a show

00:02:01.110-->00:02:03.170
You ran away, that's touch and go

00:02:04.050-->00:02:06.060
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:02:06.023-->00:02:09.040
You felt alive, that's chemical

00:02:09.210-->00:02:12.030
You felt secure, that's called a home

00:02:12.150-->00:02:15.190
Couldn't take the heat, that's Mexico

00:02:15.040-->00:02:17.190
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:02:18.030-->00:02:20.170
Said, don't look down, and then you do

00:02:20.230-->00:02:23.080
You put your past on me and you

00:02:23.090-->00:02:26.040
Think you got problems, I have too

00:02:26.120-->00:02:28.200
You ran from love, that's nothing new

00:02:29.100-->00:02:31.140
You're scared of heights, that's vertigo

00:02:32.020-->00:02:34.020
You wanted lights, go see a show

00:02:34.210-->00:02:37.030
You ran away, that's touch and go

00:02:37.130-->00:02:39.230
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:02:40.100-->00:02:42.000
Well, aren't we all?

00:02:44.000-->00:02:44.500
Yeah

00:02:45.220-->00:02:47.120
Well, aren't we all?

00:02:51.130-->00:02:54.000
You're scared of heights, that's vertigo

00:02:54.110-->00:02:56.220
You wanted lights, go see a show

00:02:57.040-->00:02:59.140
You ran away, that's touch and go

00:03:00.000-->00:03:02.060
You're scared of love, well, aren't we all?

00:03:03.020-->00:03:04.015
Well, aren't we all?
